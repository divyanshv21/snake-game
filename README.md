#Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the Turtle module.

#How to Play

The goal of the game is to control the snake and eat as much food as possible without hitting the walls or the snake's own body.
Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake:

Up arrow: Move the snake up
Down arrow: Move the snake down
Left arrow: Move the snake left
Right arrow: Move the snake right
The game will end if the snake hits the wall or its own body.

#Installation and Setup

Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/username/snake-game.git
Install Python 3 if you haven't already
Install the Turtle module using pip install turtle
Run the game using python main.py
